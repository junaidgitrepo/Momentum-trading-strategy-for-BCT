# Momentum-trading-strategy-for-BCT
Creating a momentum- trading strategy algorithm in python for BCT(bitcoin) from it's historical prices.
This startegy as the name suggests tries to take advantage of the trend or movement of asset prices both in upwards or downward trend. 
If a stock has contionous upward trend or simply put it;s prices continue to rise for the past couple days then that stocks has a rising momemtum, conversely if the stocks comtinues to fall for a couple of days then that stock has falling or downward momentum.

The profits in upward momemtum are gained bt going long on stock or simply buying stocks at lower prices and then selling at higher prices before the prices begin to fasll. Similarly in downward trend profits are gained by going short on stock or asset prices.

In this project we will have devised a trading startegy for Bitcoin from it's historical prices data in python programming language.
signals are generated for corresponging entry and exit of trades at different timestamps and profits are booked periodically. 
whether or not the stategy has been successfull can be observed by plotting the graph relative to entry and exit prices usinh matplotlib.pylot. In our project we have been successfull in gaining sizeable profits from the momentum trading strategy deployed for Bitcoin(BCT) historical data.
